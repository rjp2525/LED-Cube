## Arduino Powered LED Cube Project

This program was written for my final project in IST115G (Applied Logic), at Great Bay Community College for the Spring 2015 term. The program runs on an Arduino device to control a 4x4x4 LED cube with basic circuitry. I've updated this project repository in January 2022 because I finally found the program file I wrote for it on a long lost (but now found) USB drive. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find the circuit diagram since it was so many years ago. However, since I still have this project in a box in my parents' garage, I've included what it looks like below as of the time of writing this.
